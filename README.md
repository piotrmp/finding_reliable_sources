# Finding Reliable Sources

This repository contains the source code accompanying our study on the task of Finding Reliable Sources (FRS). The challenge of FRS is to, given a short textual claim (e.g. *Smoking tobacco is good for your helath.*), recommend a set of reliable sources (e.g. scholarly papers, publications from established institutions) that could support or refute the claim. The results of this study were described in the article *[Countering Disinformation by Finding Reliable Sources: a Citation-Based Approach](TODO)* presented at the IJCNN 2022 conference in Padoa. The datasets created for this work are published separately as [Wikipedia Complete Citation Corpus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6539054) and [FRS Evaluation Datasets](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6539087).
